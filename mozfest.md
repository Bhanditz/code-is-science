# MozFest proposal ideas

Basic format: 60 or 90 minute session

**Intro** - slides explaining [the premise of this project](readme.md) with awareness that the attendees may or may not be familiar with academic publishing models.

Workshop session to brainstorm possible ways to fix this.

Suggest whiteboard or A1 poster sheets with sticky notes. Allows people to jot down ideas without feeling too self conscious.

Topics:

- why is code so often seen as ok to be proprietary, even in science where peer review is vital?
- *who* do we need to influence?
- how can we change that?

Once everyone has had a chance to jot down ideas, go around and discuss them as a community / group like notes together.

Wrap up discussing conclusions and next steps. Grab names if anyone is interested in being involved.
