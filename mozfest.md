# MozFest proposal ideas

Basic format: 60 or 90 minute session

**Intro** - slides explaining [the premise of this project](readme.md) with awareness that the attendees may or may not be familiar with academic publishing models.

This will be followed by a workshop session to brainstorm possible ways to fix this. Suggest whiteboard or A1 poster sheets with sticky notes. Allows people to jot down ideas without feeling too self conscious.

Topics:

- why is code so often seen as ok to be proprietary, even in science where peer review is vital?
- *who* do we need to influence?
- how can we change that?

Once everyone has had a chance to jot down ideas, go around and discuss them as a community / group like notes together.

Wrap up discussing conclusions and next steps. Grab names if anyone is interested in being involved.

**How will you deal with varying numbers of participants in your session? What if 30 participants attend? What if there are 3?**
The sticky note format will work better with larger groups - I ran a similar session earlier this year at the [InterMine Developer Workshop](https://twitter.com/intermineorg/status/847886272844546048). That said, a smaller session could result in a simple group discussion. Depending in the attendees, a longer explanation of academic peer review and paper publishing may be required.
