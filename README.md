# Code is science!

Code is Science works with the scientific coding community to champion Open Source code, so we can ensure that code is peer reviewed and [FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618).

For more details about our mission see [CodeIsScience.com](http://www.codeisscience.com). If you'd like to contribute (including hacktoberfest volunteers!), head to [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) or straight to our [issues list](https://github.com/yochannah/code-is-science/issues)!

## Roadmap
This is primarily managed as a list of tickets in a [GitHub project board](https://github.com/yochannah/code-is-science/projects/1), but here's a quick rough list:

### Short term (pre-[mozfest 2017](https://mozillafestival.org/))
- prepare for [mozfest session](http://www.codeisscience.com/posts/mozfest-is-coming/)
- get [site up and running](http://www.codeisscience.com/). 
### Medium term (post-mozfest)
- write up outputs from the mozfest session
- begin technical development of journal database, including [db component](https://github.com/yochannah/code-is-science/issues/5), [api](https://github.com/yochannah/code-is-science/issues/7), [ui](https://github.com/yochannah/code-is-science/issues/9), and [search](https://github.com/yochannah/code-is-science/issues/8)

### Tasks for anywhen
- add to the "db" of journals that do (or don't) require an open source licence. Currently a google sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oY5ak7VJa-qwJJeWA3829S-1akZaYtHuWPYpChBdW2o/edit#gid=1946180293 
- Create a logo so we can send stickers to contributors: https://github.com/yochannah/code-is-science/issues/1
