# Code is science!

## Premise

**Science is often computing:** Much of modern science involves code these days, in large part due to the amount of data available - it would be almost impossible to analyse without computational assistance.

**Science requires peer review:** One of the basic prerequisites for any published scientific results is that it be reviewed by peers, to ensure the research and conclusions are valid.

**Software contains errors:** We may try pretty hard to write software without bugs, but they definitely still happen - and errors can be hard to spot. The bug doesn't have to cause [catastrophic and obvious failure](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/pogue-5-most-embarrassing-software-bugs-in-history/) - it could be silent but sneaky.

## Code == Science

If software is required to perform science, it stands to reason that errors in your software mean errors in your science.

## Possible Solution?

Scientific code needs to be peer reviewed, and ideally open source.

That's easier said than done. Getting there requires awareness, culture shift, and adherence to best practices.

This article contains some highly relevant ideas, with point 3 focusing on the need for open source:

Jiménez RC, Kuzak M, Alhamdoosh M et al. Four simple recommendations to encourage best practices in research software [version 1; referees: awaiting peer review]. F1000Research 2017, 6:876 (doi: 10.12688/f1000research.11407.1)

I'd like to try to take this further, collaborating with efforts like the movement above and [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) / [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/).

One idea that was suggested to me was to submit [a proposal for MozFest](https://mozillafestival.org/proposals). This sounds like a great way to gather feedback from open source enthusiasts about how to help effect appropriate culture shift. [More details on the proposal here](mozfest.md)
