Here are a few things that will help you create good habit when
creating scientific code and thus produce better quality code.

## Resources

* [Software carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) - resources to
  learn and teach coding practices for scientists.
* [Scientific computing for the rest of us](https://github.com/tpoisot/ScientificComputingForTheRestOfUs).

## Sites to host code

* [FigShare](https://figshare.com), hosts code and issues DOIs.
* [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io), offers project hosting, storage,
  even virtual machines.
* [GitXiv](https://gitxiv.com): Matches code in Github with articles in
  ArXiV.

## Articles with best practices

* [Good enough practices in scientific computing](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510), PLoS Comput Biol, 2017.

* [Best Practices in Scientific Computing, Wilson et al., 2014](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745).
