<h1 id="code-is-science">Code is science!</h1>

<h2 id="premise">Premise</h2>

<p><strong>Science is often computing:</strong> Much of modern science involves code these days, in large part due to the amount of data available - it would be almost impossible to analyse without computational assistance.</p>

<p><strong>Science requires peer review:</strong> One of the basic prerequisites for any published scientific results is that it be reviewed by peers, to ensure the research and conclusions are valid.</p>

<p><strong>Software contains errors:</strong> We may try pretty hard to write software without bugs, but they definitely still happen - and errors can be hard to spot. The bug doesn&rsquo;t have to cause <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/pogue-5-most-embarrassing-software-bugs-in-history/">catastrophic and obvious failure</a> - it could be silent but sneaky.</p>

<h2 id="code-science">Code == Science</h2>

<p>If software is required to perform science, it stands to reason that errors in your software mean errors in your science.</p>

<h2 id="possible-solution">Possible Solution?</h2>

<p>Scientific code needs to be peer reviewed, and ideally open source.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s easier said than done. Getting there requires awareness, culture shift, and adherence to best practices.</p>
