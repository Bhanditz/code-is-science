All ideas are welcome, providing they meet [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) guidelines.

Feel free to do one or many of the following: 
- [Contact us](http://www.codeisscience.com/contact) for further discussion about an idea or problem (email, tweet, github issue - all good!)
- Pick up an issue on GitHub. Ideally start by leaving a comment saying you're working on it so someone else doesn't pick it up as well! 

### You don't have to be a coder to participate. 
Design, documentation, and community outreach are important parts of any project.
