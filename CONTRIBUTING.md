All ideas are welcome, providing they meet [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) guidelines.

Feel free to do one or many of the following: 
- Star this repo and tell others about it. We'd love to reach >100! 
- Read [our manifesto](https://codeisscience.github.io/manifesto/) and comment on it or share it with others! 
- [Contact us](http://www.codeisscience.com/contact/) for further discussion about an idea or problem (email, tweet, github issue - all good!)
- [Pick up an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/yochannah/code-is-science/issues). Ideally start by leaving a comment saying you're working on it so someone else doesn't pick it up as well! 
- Do you wish more code was open source? Have you wished in the past that a DB of open source journals existed? Share your story: https://goo.gl/forms/k3IBxlDgi97ZTJuf2 
- Add more journals to our list: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oY5ak7VJa-qwJJeWA3829S-1akZaYtHuWPYpChBdW2o/edit#gid=1946180293 Right now it's a google form, but hopefully we'll have the full site up and running soon!

### You don't have to be a coder to participate. 
Design, documentation, and community outreach are important parts of any project.  

[Coding tasks](https://github.com/yochannah/code-is-science/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acode-task)  
[Design tasks](https://github.com/yochannah/code-is-science/labels/design%20task)

### Code Guidelines
We're in early stages of the project, so any reasonable choice of language that will run on a linux/mac machine will be considered. Javascript, Java, Clojurescript are preferred but if you would like to contribute using another language please propose it!

### What you'll get
Eternal gratitude, free stickers ([email me](mailto:yochannah@gmail.com) if you want stickers, especially if you've made a contribution :heart:), your avatar in our contributers page, and the eternal smug glow of having contributed to an open source project. <3
